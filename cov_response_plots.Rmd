## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(skimr)
library(naniar)
library(purrr)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyr)
library(visdat)
library(lubridate)
library(skimr)
library(shiny)
library(shinydashboard)
library(ggVennDiagram)
library(RColorBrewer)
```

```{r}
options(scipen = 999)
```


Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}

```{r}
